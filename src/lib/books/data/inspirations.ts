Sometimes our lives may be in a downward spiral and it might feel as if everything is disintegrating on a path of entropy. Our journey on earth is a short period of being exposed to interaction with the outer world, a period of awareness and self-reflection, which often follows a path that touches both hope and despair. I hope these snippets of life will enable the reader to rise in awareness to the inner spirit, which is eternal and divine.\n\nHuman consciousness is a special entity that interacts with whatever it focuses on, like the flame of a fire, unlike a passing wind that simply changes outer situations. Some of these stories show the effect of consciousness on an event. It is here that the narrator of the story participates in its content.\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",

As evolved human beings, any link that connects us to the origin, gives us comfort, ease and joy.\n\nWe are privileged to have numerous links to this Oneness. Language can help us to connect and unify, so does a beautiful scene, so do all our major senses-through attraction and repulsion.\n\nThe short bursts of insights in this book are steps towards being at one with the light within the heart. All our ambitions and drives ultimately lead us to the origin and creation of cosmic Oneness. Truth is one. Reality is one. Boundless eternal life is one, emanating from the One.\n\n- From the Introduction by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri ",

        description: "<b><i>\"O human you are struggling towards your Lord and striving until you come to know Him.</b></i>\" Qur'an 84:6\n\nThe notion of the complete human being or the 'Insan al-kamil' was addressed by early Islamic scholars and masters following the model of the Prophet and his exemplary conduct. Prophets, sages, imams and sufi masters have elaborated upon a life fulfilled by enlightenment and God-realisation.\n\nThis experience is the outcome of leaving behind self-illusion, identity and duality. Quality life begins when your direction is clear and you accept responsibility and accountability for your actions. Human needs and desires are endless. Acceptance of this fact is the first step. This is followed by a living faith and trust in God's perfect mercy and justice, irrespective of circumstance. Then comes the security, knowledge and experience of divine guidance through one's own soul and purified heart - a desirable destiny.\n\nAll prophets and messengers have travelled by trust and witnessed the light of Allah at all times. They lived with inner certainty and contentment. The illumined being also experiences the presence of Allah's mercy and grace; such beings can only be in ecstatic gratitude at heart, even when responding to earthly challenges. This is the complete person. Those people who have reached that station are the appropriate guides and role models to be followed. Numerous enlightened masters in the past have guided and helped humanity toward higher consciousness and happiness. Mulla Sadra (d.1640 CE) described the journey of the seeker's ascent into higher consciousness in four stages. In this work I have adopted and modified his four journeys to frame the poetry appropriately.",

With awakening you discover that, in truth, there is no differentiation or separation as everything is still contained within absolute, unitive reality.\n\nOneness is the only truth and the process of differentiating between what is good and what is not is like coming across milestones along that path. We differentiate in order to be content with the connectedness that leads to essential original Oneness.\n\nHuman consciousness links the infinite unseen with finite sensory experiences.

The utterances of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi carry with them the potency of what is real.\n\nThese interpretations use a more modern English language and understanding than the original ones under which the publication of 1935 took place.\n\nThis rendering shows the universality of original teachings. It shows what is truly inspired by truth itself is true anytime, anywhere, any place.\n\nThis version is particularly important as it interprets the original Ulladu Narpadu in the contemporary idiom.\n\nShaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, himself a realized master, relates the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi in a respectful and loving manner.\n\nThis little book is dedicated in admiration to the great teacher.",

Thus our egotistic vices can indeed be stepping stones towards acting selflessly, spontaneously, and cheerfully with heightened awareness and good expectations in all situations. Indeed, all our mistakes can lead us towards the desired spiritual awakening -- the ultimate purpose in life.\n\nShaykh Fadhlalla Haeri shares with the reader that whatever we consider confusing illusions or paradoxes are actually conducive to and helpful along the path of awakening and soul discovery. When consciousness transcends duality and recognizes all-encompassing unity, then all paradoxes and illusions are resolved. ",

It is often a travel companion as I find it so useful -- as a powerful reminder that I need constantly to 'keep me on course'. I often use it for lecture purposes -- to start off discussions on the tricks of the ego.\n\n<b><i>101 Helpful Illusions</i></b> makes an excellent gift both to yourself -- and others.\n\n<b>Highly recommended!</b>"
