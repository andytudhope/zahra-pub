        description: "<b><i>A modern-day sage's indispensable insights into how to access true fulfilment</b></i>\n\nAt the heart of life's quest lies the mystery of existence. Fulfilment Now presents the key elements needed to fulfil this quest. Through questions put to him by students, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri succinctly lays bare a terrain that shows how two zones of consciousness prevail.\n\nThis book touches on the evolutionary rise of consciousness, time and timelessness, and the eternal moment. Fuelled by the major inherent drives of consciousness, connection and continuity, humanity is driven to seek contentment and to excel along the journey towards supreme consciousness. Guides have always been an inherent part of the journey to fulfilment, but Shaykh Haeri sees in the last few decades significant shifts away from localized relationships of master-student, wherein the mirroring needed by the seeker is no longer one of exclusivity but greater self-awareness and self-accountability.\n\n<b><i>Fulfilment Now</b></i> offers fresh insight into the nature of what is sought of a teacher, the subconscious, the balance between free will and predestination, what is meant by presence, death as a natural continuation, the obsession with life, relationality, and self-governance. The central thread is that it is connecting with higher consciousness that brings about fulfilment; with that calibration, suffering is reduced. Realizing this existence is a transitory stage of being between the infinite unknown and the finite known, between self and soul, leads to a fulfilled life. <b><i>Fulfilment Now</b></i> highlights that there is no distance between the seeker and the Giver.",

        description: " Seasons of Wisdom is mostly collated from the closing unscripted talks given by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to seal the annual conferences held by the Academy of Self Knowledge in South Africa. It was his love for Qur'an that brought about a situation of regularly sharing commentaries and delights in the eternal Truth that whatever is known and unknown emanates from one Cosmic Source that is not subject to space or time.\n\n<i>\"Every living entity is a combination of a mysterious divine spirit or soul, which provides life and is eternal and boundless in nature, and a physical identity which connects the divine attributes of the soul with all earthly, transient realities and shadows. With intelligence and faith you will realize how these descriptions will provide seeds of prescriptions. If you dwell on either, you realise they are two facets of the same reality. One describes and the other leads to responsibility and drive. From the inert to the dynamic and moving.</i>\"\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",
