        description: "<b><i>A modern-day sage's indispensable insights into how to access true fulfilment</b></i>\n\nAt the heart of life's quest lies the mystery of existence. Fulfilment Now presents the key elements needed to fulfil this quest. Through questions put to him by students, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri succinctly lays bare a terrain that shows how two zones of consciousness prevail.\n\nThis book touches on the evolutionary rise of consciousness, time and timelessness, and the eternal moment. Fuelled by the major inherent drives of consciousness, connection and continuity, humanity is driven to seek contentment and to excel along the journey towards supreme consciousness. Guides have always been an inherent part of the journey to fulfilment, but Shaykh Haeri sees in the last few decades significant shifts away from localized relationships of master-student, wherein the mirroring needed by the seeker is no longer one of exclusivity but greater self-awareness and self-accountability.\n\n<b><i>Fulfilment Now</b></i> offers fresh insight into the nature of what is sought of a teacher, the subconscious, the balance between free will and predestination, what is meant by presence, death as a natural continuation, the obsession with life, relationality, and self-governance. The central thread is that it is connecting with higher consciousness that brings about fulfilment; with that calibration, suffering is reduced. Realizing this existence is a transitory stage of being between the infinite unknown and the finite known, between self and soul, leads to a fulfilled life. <b><i>Fulfilment Now</b></i> highlights that there is no distance between the seeker and the Giver.",

It shows us how to attain greater levels of inner stability in an unstable world so that we can deal with, and even appreciate the outer instability we find ourselves in, rather than constantly resisting it.\n\nThe course takes us a step at a time towards the realization that we are outwardly limited but inwardly far more than who we thought we were. It shows us how to prioritize everything that is sacred and enduring in our lives and to discard all that casts us far from the One. The book gives us the means by which we can nurture this higher aspect within ourselves in a wholesome way, making it an invaluable guide to life.",

Based on the cosmology/view that the heart is the connecting point between the soul (the eternal), and the self (the ephemeral), the course focuses on transformation through awareness and following the practices of the Prophetic path.\n\nThis way of transformation includes being accountable and responsible while being continually aware of the soul and higher consciousness. We learn that we must continually strive for perfection but with the knowledge that no one attains such perfection in an enduring way and that it is God's perfect attributes that permeate all of existence and bind, unify and drive creation towards fulfillment.\n\nThe objective of this course is to enable the seeker to love the One unconditionally and deal with multiplicity rationally.

This divergence between <i>Iman</i> and <i>Kufr</i> taking place in Pakistan is only a reflection of a condition occurring everywhere else in the Muslim world, and indeed in the rest of the world today.\n\nThis volume of collected talks, which includes a detailed commentary on Surah al-Infitar (Surah 82), is relevant to anyone who is seeking a way out of the chaos of a collapsing, amoral Kufr society, and a clear guidance and knowledge of an alternative way of living -- a code of conduct that will enable him to travel with humility and purpose toward his Creator and the fulfillment of his noble destiny.

They are deeply engaging and inspiring for any serious seeker.\n\nThese interviews were transcribed by Julia Khadija Lafene and edited by Anjum Jaleel.\n\nIn order to publish it as a book, chapter headings, subheadings and footnotes have been added, many gaps within the conversations have been filled, and footnotes and a glossary have been added.
