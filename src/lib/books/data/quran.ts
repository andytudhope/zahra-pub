        description: "\"<i>There are numerous challenges and quests in human life. The most powerful drive, however, is to understand and connect with that which is timeless and boundless. Our keen interest in the beginning of creation and its end is part of this quest. The Qur’an is the voice of truth which involves what is considered to be rational and shareable consciousness. The majesty of the Qur’an is that it addresses most of the human situation and day to day realities whilst connecting it with the Absolute and Boundless. At a normal, conditioned, human consciousness, the Qur’an can help to reduce suffering and discord, but a point is reached where spiritual insights go beyond the mind and into the realm of the soul where discernment and differentiations melt away into a zone where energy and matter are not distinguishable. For this reason, most classical scholars of Qur’an refer to this higher level as the Divine Domain and refrain from commenting or discussing it.</i>\"\n – <b>From the Foreword by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</b>\n\nThe <i>Irfani</i> reflections and commentaries presented by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri in this book provide a bridge between rational understanding and spiritual insights of the Qur’an. This production urges the reader to travel deeper and higher in their consciousness to achieve their ultimate destiny – awareness of awareness of the Ultimate Oneness of our existence.\n\nThis edition contains a Foreword by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, an introduction by the editor Shaykh Saadi Douglas Klotz, and an introduction by the translator of the Qur’anic verses Dr Adnan Al Adnani.

        description: "There is a purpose to this life. There is a beginning, and an end, and within it lies a light that has no beginning and no end. We are most fortunate to have been given the total package of truth, of haqq. We have come to this world in order to discover the qualities and attributes of the Creator of it, the Maintainer of it, the Sustainer of it; He who is within it, He who is before it, He who is after it. We have been bestowed with the ultimate purpose and meaning of our existence, along with the direction and way we must conduct ourselves to become in tune with the ever-present light of Allah.\n\nThe Qur'an affrms that there cannot be two unless I am with you, there cannot be three unless I am the fourth (58:7); and I am closer to you than your jugular vein: And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind suggests to him, and We are nearer to him than his life-vein (50:16). Where is it that His nur (light), or its trace and pattern, is not already there? We are most fortunate to have embraced the divine light of the Prophet Muhammad (S). We are truly blessed to have trust and love for the Qur'an and to have profound admiration for the conduct and all that which has to do with the perfect being of Prophet Muhammad (S). Why is it then, that this miraculous guide, this revealed knowledge, has not been in every way adored, used and internalised? The answer is simple. You may have the recipe for a meal, but if you don't put the ingredients together to cook it and eat it, you will not get nourishment from it. Similarly, simply possessing knowledge without implementing it will not illuminate you mind. And at a higher level, it will not enlighten your heart.\n\nThe Qur'an is a remarkable gift for us to use to change our attitude. The information contained within it has the power to lead to our transformation. The voice of truth from beyond time and space can be applied in our lives within time and space. In the following pages, we will dive into the Qur'an and its multi-layers of wisdom, knowledge and light. There are no ends to these horizons. As far as the Qur'an is concerned, it is the book of existence; it is the manual that any true believer in the One will find of immediate help in any situation and for any circumstance. One of the meanings of the Qur'an is that which gathers and has within it everything. The Qur'an has come with a language that surpasses the limitations of an ordinary terrestrial language. It contains terms that refer to the physical and material world, yet they also carry celestial connotations, evoking higher and subtler meanings",

        title: "Keys to the Qur'an: A Commentary on Selected Surahs",
        description: "<b><i>This is the full, hardcover version. You can find each of the five sections separately in the <a href=\"/quran\">Qur'an</a> section.</b></i>\n\nThese commentaries on several essential chapters of the Qur'an are based on Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's teachings in the West. The chapters include Surahs Fatiha, Baqarah, Ale `Imran, Yaseen, Al `Ankabut, Al Rahman, Al Waq`iah, Al Mulk and the entire Juz `Amma (last section of the Qur'an). These explorations of selected chapters of the Qur'an are aimed at those seeking guidance and transformation in the modern world. Emphasising the timeless wisdom of the Qur'an, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri uses the linguistic roots of the key terms to offer illuminating insights into its deep inner meanings, and shows its relevance to our present day lives. As a source of understanding for both Muslims and non-Muslims, this volume of 5 parts will be greatly valued.\n\nThe Qur'an reflects the absolute truth in all respects. It guides towards knowledge of numerous realities. In it one hears the eternal song of mercy, love and the oneness of creational reality. In the Qur'an we see the laws which govern the experiential, physical word as well as the subtle hidden worlds above and below.\n\nThe Qur'an tells the story of creation from before creation to beyond the end of creation. It takes one to its source--the timeless, boundless, All-Encompassing Absolute Creator.\n\nKeys to the Qur'an is based on discourses given by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri in America and Europe. This volume looks to the Qur'an for existential guidance and direction in this life. It does not resemble other traditional commentaries. It seeks from the Qur'an a way of living that will enable humankind, here and now, to travel courageously, purposefully and humbly toward enlightenment and awakening.",

        description: "\"In our contemporary world where race, religion, culture and other human characteristics meet, connect, fuse, overlap and clash, so many challenges regarding faith, belief and metaphysical issues present themselves. The Abrahamic traditions are the result of thousands of prophets and messengers coming to guide humankind which culminated with the Prophet Muhammad, whose gift of the Qur'an is of universal value.\n\nThe Qur'ans miracle is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. This selection of key verses are universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.\n\nThis book presents Qur'anic Universal renderings that connects the absolute and the relative in a unified voice that transforms and transports the reader to the eternal reality that is both transcendent and immanent. It is an essential reference for the inner technology guiding towards transformation that echoes in the hearts of the sincere seeker.\"\n\n- Adnan al Adnani, author of <b><i>Lights of Consciousness: A Sufi view of Science</b></i> and <b><i>Spirituality</b></i>\n\n\"Shaykh Fadhlalla's wise commentary and rendering of the verses enable the reader, whether newcomer or more experienced, to clearly understand the Qur'anic map and guide to life. This little book opens a door allowing us to hear a wake-up call for all humanity, regardless of belief or philosophy of life.\"\n\n- Dr Neil Douglas-Klotz, author of <b><i>The Sufi Book of Life</b></i> and <b><i>A Little Book of Sufi Stories</b></i>.",

Considerable emphasis is given to relative time and human concerns on earth and the connection between the inseparability of the relative and the Absolute. The Qur'an emphasizes that anything that exists or happens is due to God and equally emphasizes human responsibility to act and live with clear accountability to God.\n\nThe main difference between other traditions and religions at the time of the Prophet Muhammad is the perplexing notion that, in truth, there is only God, and all else are shadows in this Light.\n\nTo understand the Qur’an and use it as a template, this brief background is necessary. This booklet presents extracts from talks I have given on the subject, arranged in six themes: Context and Action, the Self, Understanding, Transformation, Awakening and lastly Oneness and Balance.</i>\"\n\n- From the Introduction by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri ",

This surah is so named because if you follow it in your heart, you will be victorious. You will conquer and an opening will come to you./n/n<b><i>Surah al-Baqarah</b></i> scans the history of humankind from Adam to the time of the Prophet Muhammad. It contains a blueprint of how a community can live, how its members should behave as individuals, within their families, and in economic and social terms. It also gives guidance and prescriptions regarding inner and outer struggle and development.",

        reviews: "<b>By Nazo Hadi</b>\n\nI am a born Muslim and was exposed to the Qur'an from an early age, but I was never satisfied with the commentaries I read.\n\nThe Qur'an seemed to talk about events in the past, but I wanted to know how it relates to my life in this time and age.\n\nIn most commentaries the commentators follow the chapters and verses. In this book, Shaykh Fadhlalla has chosen topics which are important to everyday life and selected and collected all the verses relevant to those topics in the appendix at the end of the book, I found this approach very helpful when I wanted to look up what the Qur'an says about a certain topic.\n\nThe central theme of the Qur'an is its emphasis on Allah/God as the One source and Essence that permeates the entire universe. All manifestations come from Allah, are sustained by Him and return to Him. The entire universe is in submission to Allah.\n\nAccording to the Qur'an our job is to groom the ego and adhere to His laws and regulations so that we become aware of the Divine Presence at all times.\n\nThis book is useful for serious Muslims and anyone who is interested to know the basic message of the Qur'an. It is a very good introduction for beginners and inspires one to read and have a better understanding of the Qur'an.\n\nIt has led me to listen to the Shaykh's other commentaries on his website (http://www.shaykhfadhlallahaeri.com) and has transformed my life.\n\nFor example, his commentary on Surah Aale Imran -- 3: 179 -- to accept the present and trust in Allah for the future has helped me to deal with a lot of worry and anxiety in my life and given me peace of mind.\n\nIn addition it has changed my relationship with the Qur'an so that now I actually enjoy reading it.\n\n\n<b>By Anjum J - May 31, 2022</b>\n\nThis gem of a book is extremely deep and requires a lot of reflection before one can grasp its inner meanings and allow it to penetrate one's consciousness at its deepest levels.\n\nWe have a group weekly Zoom session in which we go over and dissect every sub-chapter of the book each week.\n\nSo, I know, from first-hand experience of diving deep into this book, that it is full of wisdom and spiritual nourishment, in spite of the fact that I was already quite familiar with what is written in this book before I started to participate in its weekly reading; yet, everything in it seems fresh and deep as well as extremely inspiring in that the book helps me to experience a deep connection and integration with the Divine Unity.\n\nThose who have praised this book in their editorial reviews of it (Dr. Neil Douglas-Klotz, Dr. Bruce B Lawrence and Ali A. Allawi) have done so with utmost honesty, and their reviews are quite on the mark and helpful.\n\nRepetition of certain concepts in it may bother someone at first, but please know that if you examine them from various angles, you'll appreciate their repetition as they unfold new meanings each time they are addressed.\n\nI'd highly recommend that this book be read slowly, with deep reflection, along with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's other books, especially his book on the <a href=\"/book/sufi-map-self\">Academy of Self Knowledge (ASK) Course ONE</a> and \"<a href=\"/book/witnessing-perfection\">Witnessing Perfection</a>\".\n\nDr. Adnan al-Adnani's \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lights-Consciousness-Sufi-Science-Spirituality/dp/B01CFC1D7Y\" target=\"_blank\">Lights of Consciousness: A Sufi view of Science & Spirituality</a>\" is also a great aid to understanding this book.\n\nAnother extremely important thing a reader can do is examine the root meanings of the key terms used in the relevant Qur'anic verses that are included in this book for each sub-chapter in Arabic and look for the same terms used elsewhere in the Qur'an and see how they are connected and their deep meanings are unfolded.\n\nIn summary, this book is an \"aid\" to understanding the essential message of the Qur'an, which requires a reader to use it to dive into the inner meanings of the Qur'an by examining the many key terms in Arabic.\n\nThis will require extra effort on the part of the student of the Qur'an who will use this book as the rungs of a ladder to climb up and raise their consciousness to experience Divine Unity, which is the main, and essential, message of the Qur'an anyway.\n\nSo, repetition of Divine Unity in this book simply means that the rungs of that ladder are repeated.\n\nBut, as we all know, how else one would climb up the ladder if its rungs are not repeated?"

This is missing from other books, which only focus on matching outer phenomena to scientific discovery without inner reflection.\n\nThe Story of Creation in the Qur'an relates outer patterns and symbols to inner experiences and metaphors bringing out the gnostic elements not just the prescriptive and phenomenal descriptions.

        title: "Journey of the Universe as Expounded in the Qur'an",
        description: "\"The Qur'an itself is the great ocean of truth that lies undiscovered before us. In 'Journey of the Universe' the Shaykh has built an island in this vast Qur'anic see of knowledge so that we on the shore can build a bridge to it from religion, or from science or from wherever we may stand. Then, when we have bridged this gap between our intellectual knowledge and what is already written in our hearts we see, on looking back to the shore we left, the whole landscape of our existence from an entirely new perspective.\n\nThe creation of the Universe is the eternal instant unfolding in time. There was the 'nothingness' and with the fiat of creation, 'kun fa-yakun', the 'nothingness' was split into the duality of existence, symbolized in the first Arabic letter 'alif', the primary mark of creation that descends from God. Viewed from the other side of time, from where we stand, there was this vast creation of immense energy that flung everything into separation, which we can liken to an explosion, or theorize as the 'Big Bang'. But everything is from its Creator and must return to its Lord.\"\n\n- From the <b><i>Foreword</b></i> by Ibrahim Stokes\n\nThe Qur'an traces the journey of all creation explicitly and implicitly, seeing the physical, biological and geological voyage of life as paralleled by the inner spiritual evolution of man. Bringing together the meanings and derivations of individual words, the author reveals vibrant images which the language of the Qur'an so subtly projects.",
