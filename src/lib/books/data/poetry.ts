There is no power and no strength except through Allah, the Magnificent. There is no victor except Him. There is no presence except His. There is nothing and none sought after besides Him. There is no beloved except Him. Oh He, Oh He, Oh He who there is no he except He.\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",

        description: "In these stories I would like to show the many different ways that people strive towards a better life that is more secure and enjoyable. Sometimes our lives may be in a downward spiral and it might feel as if everything is disintegrating on a path of entropy. Our journey on earth is a short period of being exposed to interaction with the outer world, a period of awareness and self-reflection, which often follows a path that touches both hope and despair. I hope these snippets of life will enable the reader to rise in awareness to the inner spirit, which is eternal and divine.\n\nHuman consciousness is a special entity that interacts with whatever it focuses on, like the flame of a fire, unlike a passing wind that simply changes outer situations. Some of these stories show the effect of consciousness on an event. It is here that the narrator of the story participates in its content.\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",

        description: " The word \"Hikari\" is often used in various contexts in Japanese culture, including literature, art, and everyday language, to convey different shades of meaning related to light and its symbolic significance.\n\nReality emanates from the perpetual cosmic Oneness that radiates numerous patterns of lights which brings about life. As evolved human beings, any link that connects us to the origin, gives us comfort, ease and joy.\n\nWe are privileged to have numerous links to this Oneness. Language can help us to connect and unify, so does a beautiful scene, so do all our major senses-through attraction and repulsion.\n\nThe short bursts of insights in this book are steps towards being at one with the light within the heart. All our ambitions and drives ultimately lead us to the origin and creation of cosmic Oneness. Truth is one. Reality is one. Boundless eternal life is one, emanating from the One.\n\n- From the Introduction by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri ",

        title: "The Four Journeys",
        description: "<b><i>\"O human you are struggling towards your Lord and striving until you come to know Him.</b></i>\" Qur'an 84:6\n\nThe notion of the complete human being or the 'Insan al-kamil' was addressed by early Islamic scholars and masters following the model of the Prophet and his exemplary conduct. Prophets, sages, imams and sufi masters have elaborated upon a life fulfilled by enlightenment and God-realisation.\n\nThis experience is the outcome of leaving behind self-illusion, identity and duality. Quality life begins when your direction is clear and you accept responsibility and accountability for your actions. Human needs and desires are endless. Acceptance of this fact is the first step. This is followed by a living faith and trust in God's perfect mercy and justice, irrespective of circumstance. Then comes the security, knowledge and experience of divine guidance through one's own soul and purified heart - a desirable destiny.\n\nAll prophets and messengers have travelled by trust and witnessed the light of Allah at all times. They lived with inner certainty and contentment. The illumined being also experiences the presence of Allah's mercy and grace; such beings can only be in ecstatic gratitude at heart, even when responding to earthly challenges. This is the complete person. Those people who have reached that station are the appropriate guides and role models to be followed. Numerous enlightened masters in the past have guided and helped humanity toward higher consciousness and happiness. Mulla Sadra (d.1640 CE) described the journey of the seeker's ascent into higher consciousness in four stages. In this work I have adopted and modified his four journeys to frame the poetry appropriately.",
