      title: "Reflections of the Awakened: Commentary of Surah Fatiha attributed to Imam Al Hussain (AS)",
      author: "Sadraddin Al-Qunawi. Notes by Sayyid Hasan Askari.",
      description: "<b><i>Reflections of Awakened (Mirat'l-Arifin)</b></i> is a treatise of great importance which sets forth in a compact and systematic manner, the central concerns of the mystical dimension of Islam. Some attribute it to Sadraddin al-Qunawi, and others regard it as a work of Imam Husayn (AS). <i>Mirat'l-Arifin</i> itself contains the explicit reference to its theme of inquiry into the Opening of the Book. The inquiry starts with the reference to the well-known formulation: what is in the entire Quran is in its Opening. What is elaborated in the Quran is epitomized in the Opening (fatiha). The Opening is in fact a summation, and hence the Point under the letter, Ba, is the final symbol of the epitome of all knowledge. To call the Opening of the Book as the Source of the Book is to define the latter after the principle of summation and totality. The <i>Mirat'l-Arifin</i> revolutionizes the concept of 'kitab' (book) by saying that this world is in fact two-fold, the world of command (amnr) and the world of creation (khalq), and each is a book from the books of God; and for each is a fatiha. In other words, for each there is a 'umm'l-kitab' and a 'kitab'l-mubin'. Real knowledge consists in knowing the 'umm'l-kitab' of each realm, but Man, as we are told, is a comprehensive book among the books of God, and a 'barzakh' for both the Divine and the Cosmic Realities. Hence, to know both the worlds is to know Man. Self-Knowledge is the knowledge of all things of all places and all times, for Man is the summation of all things; and within man is the secret (sirr) of His Lord-\"whoever knows his self knows His Lord\".\n\nSayyid Hasan Askari was widely known as one of the few Muslim scholars in the field of Comparative Religion. He taught at Osmania, Aligarh, American University of Beirut and the Free University of Amsterdam. He was on the staff of the Centre of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations and Professor at the Faculty of Comparative Religion at the University of Antwerp. He has lectured at the universities of Heidelberg, Gottingen, Hamburg, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Princeton. His works include 'Society and State in Islam' and 'Inter-Religion'; The Experience of Religious Diversity among others. He has worked on Islamic Theory of Knowledge and also on an extensive volume about Ali ibn abi Talib and Sufi Orders.",

        description: "<b><i>Transformative Worship in Islam - Experiencing Perfection</b></i> uniquely bridges the traditional practices and beliefs, culture and language of Islam with the transformative spiritual states described by the Sufis and Gnostics. In this collection of teachings on how the worship of Islam can transform insight and perception of Reality, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri presents profound guidance for those who journey through the path of Islamic belief and practice. He draws from the Noble Qur'an, the Prophet's traditions, narrations from the Ahl al-Bayt and seminal works from Sufi masters and scholars.\n\n<b><i>Transformative Worship in Islam - Experiencing Perfection</b></i> will inspire the serious seeker of spiritual knowledge to make the connections between intention, attention and direction. Describing in detail the stages of spiritual evolvement, the author highlights the need for grooming the self, refining its lower tendencies, practicing self-accountability, and guiding it towards the higher virtues of the soul, through the regular discipline of a worship which brings one into Divine Presence.\n\nThe seeker will be taken to the stages of self-realization where all dualities meet and unify within the human soul. The purified heart is a precondition for this awakening, while enlightenment is the natural outcome after dispelling all causes of egotistic confusion and concern for personal survival. This book reveals how the soul is forever embedded in sustainable joy and contentment and awakening to this condition is not only our birth-right but the very purpose of our existence. ",

I'm someone who is constantly reading and learning and found this book to be within a whole new class of its own. Spirituality is not a romantic ideal, but a very real endeavour of tearing away the self accumulated junk; the Shaykh, for me, was able to give me the tools to be able to do this. I particularly resonated with his section on the prayer. He wrote of perspectives that were so unusual they could only be divine and yet upon reflection they were what I needed all along, a transformative interpretation of all that is done within the prayer.\n\nMy prayers hold a very different meaning since I've read his book.\n\n<b>Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's Response to the Above Feedback</b>\n\nOur wordly experiences are preparations for real life which is akhirah, the entry of it is death. Prostration is the doorway to leaving the mind behind and entering the boundless zone of the soul. The ultimate duty is to live as a soul which illumines body and mind through a purified heart. The purpose of our deen is to be able to do that."

        author: "Imam Ja`far Al-Sadiq (Translated By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri and Muna H. Bilgrami)",
        description: "<b>IMAM JA`FAR AL-SADIQ</b> uThe sixth Imam in the line of the Twelve Imams descended from the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Ja`far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq (702-765 C.E. or 17th Rabi` al-Awwal 83 AH - 15th Shawwal 148 AH) was the founder of the Ja`fari School of Islamic Law and a renowned scholar of his age. His father was the Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and his mother, Farwa, was a great-granddaughter of Abu Bakr. He lived in Arabia in the eighth century. He devoted his attention to interpreting divine utterances and applied himself to such controversial subjects as iraadah (free will) and qadr (the power to direct one's own actions). He is regarded as one of the greatest of the imams and is also revered by the Naqshbandi Sunni Sufi chain.\n\n<b>THE LANTERN OF THE PATH</b>\n\n<b><i>The Lantern of The Path</b></i> comprises ninety-nine chapters. Each one is a threshold to the next, guiding the reader through the broad spectrum of ageless wisdom, like a lantern along the path of reality. The author illuminates the inner meanings of outer practices which range from practical everyday acts of behavior, to the practices of worship, morals and ethics, and the pillars of religion.\n\n<b> ABOUT THIS TRANSLATION</b>This small and simple book was most difficult and complex to translate. The translation was begun four years ago by my father, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, when he translated 'The Lantern of The Path' during some discourses.\n\nThough the task then fell to me to coordinate and execute the final translation, it was not without the considerable help of several scholars that the final version was achieved. A formal translation was first done by Aisha Abdar-Rahman Al-Tarjumana.\n\nBoth hers and Shaykh Fadhlalla's versions were used in translating it anew, throughout which Muhsin Muzaffar helped in unearthing the meanings of obscure words and phrases.\n\nThis translation was subsequently reviewed and edited by both Asadullah adh-Dhakir Yate and Christopher Flint. I am deeply grateful to all of them, not least for all that I learnt in the process, especially from my father. I sincerely hope that for those who read 'The Lantern of The Path', it will open up inner delights, as it has done for me.\n\nMuna H. Bilgrami",

        reviews: "<b>By Ayesha Powell</b>\n\nThis has to be one of the most useful, practical and clear handbooks on the Divine Names of Allah ever written. Based on the solid foundations of Tawhid (unity) and the Prophetic Traditions, this beautiful book, also now available as an e-book, may be used to enhance our understanding of how the One works in every aspect around us in our world and could help us to establish a deep and sustainable connection with our highest potential, making divine patterns, ways and decrees more accessible to us, at a critical time in mankind's history and conscious evolution.\n\nUsed with humility and sincerity, it may help us resonate with each majestic and beautiful Name, taking our consciousness to higher realms and through us, the consciousness of the world. For how else do some of Allah's attributes manifest but through our creative thought and action? We are caught in His Names, we may as well use them for our conscious evolution, the benefit of the earth and the rest of creation--just like our beloved Prophet did and the countless other prophets and messengers did before him.\n\nSo this is an important book. It is a lucid introduction to a profound and vast subject covering aspects of `ibada (worship), the realms of creation and our role as sincere human beings who witness the power and glory and mercy of the One. The book also provides very useful guidelines on the etiquette of supplication: how we must call Him and why sometimes our calling seems to go unheard.\n\nThe simple layout makes the book very easy as a manual of reference. There is perhaps a little repetition in the introduction but the Names themselves are clearly and simply presented in elegant Arabic calligraphy with English transliteration and translation. There follows a brief etymological (the author's speciality--see the series Keys to The Quran) description, which by no means claims to be comprehensive. After all, how can we \"define\" the Names in the entirety of their depths and meaning? The author is merely giving us a tantalising glimpse of what these Divine Names could mean for us as individuals, and their use in our daily lives, without any esoteric mumbo-jumbo.\n\nHighly recommended for Muslims and non-Muslims alike and anyone seeking the tools of judgement and discernment and protection to navigate through our ever-increasingly complex world"

Ultimately all aspects and practices of the Shari`ah impact upon the process of grooming and refining the character of the practitioner.\n\nBy sharing these most transformative teachings from the world of Islam, the author hopes to make available the spiritual nourishment that has sustained and propelled him personally in his own quest for sublime knowledge and true freedom.",

For fourteen centuries, Muslims have undertaken the pilgrimage and today it is the world's largest annual spiritual gathering. <b><i>Pilgrimage in Islam</i></b> is a lucid exposition of the Hajj, the journey to the House of God, the <i>Ka`bah</i>, which is situated in the heart of the sacred city of Mecca. One of the five pillars of the Islamic faith, the Hajj is obligatory on all Muslims who are able to undertake the journey at least once in a lifetime. The Prophet Muhammad's original Hajj is described, upon which the present-day pilgrimage is based, and a step by step account offers the reader a rare insight into the inner meaning of the outer rites of the Hajj, for ultimately, the physical journey to Mecca is also a spiritual pilgrimage to the knowledge of God.",
