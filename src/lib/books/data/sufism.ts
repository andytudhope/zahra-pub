        title: "Pathways to the Garden: Contemporary Insights on the Sufi Path",
        description: " It is a natural human drive to discover and develop the perfect Garden. We long for a state where we have no concerns, anxieties or needs, just living in the Garden in the eternal drift of time. Only a few reach a point of bewilderment when they are not certain whether the Garden is in them or they are in the Garden. Truth is beyond space and time; therefore, its apparent confusion is a big grace when the ‘you’ is lost and the cosmic Oneness illuminates all.\n\nCosmic Light is boundless and eternal. Throughout human history, irrespective of religious orientation or culture, people have reflected on the eternal truth of this reality. Some of these sages, like Shaykh Sa`d ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī, were able to convey this in a universal light. In my experience and understanding, the conditioned consciousness of human beings has within it a drive towards higher consciousness and intelligence. Throughout our history, this appears in diverse ways and forms, cloaked within the culture of the time. With the rise in intelligence and education, today’s people can easily understand duality and the quest for unity without it being too esoteric. Young people today can also easily appreciate the truth that our existence has emerged from a mysterious unific source and will return to it after the end of time. Every one of us is challenged by the mystery of now, which is ever-changing and constant, and the unique gift of life.\n\nAll quests and teachings lead to the realization that the soul, or essence of life, is eternal and that the moment radiates from timelessness. We are obsessed with that which is eternal and ever-present. In my lifelong search to uncover and share the dazzling lights of Truth, I have been propelled to make more accessible translations of specific seminal texts from the Sufi tradition available, as I have done with <i>‘The Secret Garden’</i>. This book, <i>‘Pathways to the Garden’</i> is presented as an update to key questions for today’s time.\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",

        description: "<b><i>With Muneera Haeri</b></i>\n\nAn unparalleled exploration of Sufism as it is practised around the world, describing meetings with today's enlightened teachers as well as including wonderfully inspiring translations of the great Sufi masters of the past. Ultimately, this book acts as a guide to the Sufi path and offers wise insight into the meaning and purpose of life.\n\nA compelling view of Sufi history together with vivid personal remembrances of living mystics.\n\n\"This is an inspiring and at the same time beautifully subtle book, with light-filled insights on every page.\" - Saadi Shakur Chishti, author of <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0142196355\" target=\"_blank\">The Sufi Book of Life</a></i>. The Sufi path described in this book leads the seeker past ordinary states of consciousness towards a new experience of infinitude that is the source of the universe. In this stage there is no duality or otherness, but instead infinitude, the Original Oneness, from which all dualities and attributes emanate.\n\nThe book is at once an autobiography, a didactic treatise and a literary opus full of wonderful translations of the words of earlier Sufis, as well as the author's own poetry. It describes Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's life quest to connect today's world with classical times, especially through his meetings with enlightened Sufis all over the globe. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri also addresses profound Sufi teachings concerning the nature of humankind, the cosmos and God, using clear and simple language to address difficult doctrinal issues as only a master who has digested fully such knowledge could do. The book also reveals much about the present-day Islamic world where, despite the tragedies that are to be seen everywhere, tradition and spirituality survive. This is a metaphysical and spiritual guide to the Sufi path that ultimately offers insight into the meaning and purpose of life.",

        description: "Spectrum of Reality synthesizes a comprehensive analysis of the human condition and the way we perceive reality. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri makes difficult concepts accessible, especially through the use of metaphors, allegories, and insights from modern science. His thesis is that human consciousness manifests in several ways across a spectrum that ranges from universal supreme consciousness to personal conditioned consciousness. It is the nature of human culture, thought and personal consciousness to continually operate in a dualistic way, so that Reality is obscured by several layers of fragmentation.\n\nThe ultimate harmony of human consciousness with universal reality is the challenge of existence. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri illustrates that we can heal the split between individual and the universal by recognising that each is essential to its different territory, and believes that 'spirit' is the causal factor from which all states arise.

        reviews: "<b>By Hasan Joban</b>\n\nThe quest for lasting, durable happiness and contentment is very much a part of human nature. It could be argued that every human action, no matter how it manifests, is an attempt at echoing this primal impulse for experiencing peace and joy. Occasionally, we manage to capture the blissful moment, only to see it wriggle from our clutches and replaced all-too-quickly by longer periods of agitation, turbulence and anxiety.\n\nIn Witnessing Perfection, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri provides a road map for the journey of life that can facilitate the experiencing of this state of durable peace. The opening lines of the Introduction set the scene: \"Lasting fulfilment can only be achieved when an aspect of perfection is perceived within every moment. Every moment contains a glimpse of perfection\".\n\nWhat follows through subsequent pages is the unfolding of a formula, immersed in spiritual wisdom, which discusses such issues as the nature of the self, the relationship between self and soul, the family, civilizations and cultures, and the ultimate goal of personal transformation through self-knowledge. However, it is only by constant reference to an internal unifying essence underpinning everything, Shaykh Fadhlalla points out, that lasting happiness can be experienced. This is a recurring theme. In essence, what we learn is that the more our intentions, thoughts and actions are wedded to this pristine reference point within us, the greater the likelihood of achieving durable bliss. How does this exactly happen? Shaykh Fadhlalla explains:\n\n\"The journey of the spiritual seeker begins by looking for meaning and patterns behind events, feelings and experiences. The compass of this journey is the reference to the essence of life, which is the soul within the human's heart. When all dualities and opposites are seen through this unified lens, all of these experiences and events will change in meaning and significance. Conflicts, difficulties and disappointments will no longer bring about undue suffering and emotional reactions. This new state of authentic understanding enables the person to interact wisely with the outer world, whilst experiencing harmony and ease at heart. The door to the magnificent present moment and the joy therein begins to open\" (p. xv-xvi).\n\nThe book outlines a broad map to reaching this magnificent moment. There is a wealth of teaching emanating from the pages, punctuated by frequent aphorisms that glisten in their wisdom. This book is not meant to be read cover to cover in one sitting and then returned to the bookshelf; instead, it needs to be placed within arm's reach so that it can be delved into again and again for deep and frequent reflection. As the author explains, \"To fully benefit and be transformed by this book you need to read, reflect and apply what touches and benefits you most... Apply what is relevant to you at the time and trust that there is perfection within every situation and experience\". (p. xv).\n\nWhat impact has this book had on me personally? I have had this book for a while now; I refer to it frequently and can say that it has had a deep and transformative impact. One benefit that I would like to share is that I am comforted by the meaning of the self as expounded in the book. It provides me with a map by which to understand the nature of my own emotions, thoughts, desires, anxieties, and so on. This perspective helps me to identify when I might be getting overwhelmed by my own feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, or blaming others for my misfortune, and therefore enables me to change my thinking accordingly. It helps me to reflect upon the feelings of affliction as indicating whether I am aligned to the pristine essence within or not. Thus, rather than reacting in a knee-jerk fashion, I might take a moment to reflect and then act appropriately, as befits the perfect moment! In my view, to be guided to cultivate that attitude alone makes Witnessing Perfection worth having.\n\nThis book comes highly recommended to anyone who is interested in self-knowledge, personal transformation, and a desire to partake in a healthy and balanced life."

        description: "In <b><i>Happiness in Life and After Death -- An Islamic Sufi View</b></i>, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri provides a lucid and inspiring account of life, death and the hereafter, according to an Islamic Sufi perspective.\n\nThe book opens with a wide-ranging sweep of death and dying as viewed in other cultures and religions -- from ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Zoroastrian sources through to Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBased on the Qur'an and Prophetic message, this book offers a splendid collection of revelations and spiritual teachings that map a basic path towards a wholesome way of living without forgetting death. There is both physical and spiritual death, and death in both instances is seen as a natural bridge from the suffering and delusions of this life to a unifying and clear abode. As the reader is led from birth of the ephemeral self on earth through an unfolding progression towards higher consciousness and awakening to the eternal soul within, constant awareness of one's intimate dual nature takes away much of the fear of death and makes it seem like a familiar companion.",

        reviews: "<b>By J.K.Lafene</b>\n\nThe title of this book is arresting, to say the least. It immediately leads us to reflect on the meaning of happiness in this life and to wonder how it is connected to the afterlife.\n\nMost people, even believers, think of happiness only in terms of satisfaction with this life. If we have no belief in the afterlife, we concentrate on trying to enjoy this life and avoid thinking much about death. If we are believers we usually have a vague idea that we'll either be forgiven and live in heaven or (if we've been very wicked) will be consigned to Hell. But we hope for and expect mercy and take comfort in the belief that the wicked will get their just deserts!\n\nThis book gives us a detailed exposition of the nature of the human being in this life, how what we do here is intimately connected to the next life (the real life), and how we can prepare for what will occur after leaving the body, based on the Islamic Sufi interpretation of the teaching of the Holy Qur'an and hadith of the Prophet (saw) and Imams.(as)\n\nProspective readers may say, \"will this book tell me how I can be happy here and hopefully not fear death?\" the answer is 'Certainly', but not in the way they might imagine -- that is, like a 'self-help' book giving advice on 'attributes of effective people' or such like. Such manuals are indeed useful, but this book makes us realise that 'happiness', which it defines as 'consistent inner contentment and peace' and 'witnessing perfection in every situation', is not achieved without considerable effort; but it is unquestionably worth it!\n\nUltimately happiness in this life is \"to be a friend of God and reliant on the sacred light, which 'brings about joy and is beyond fear or sorrow'\". How? In his description of human nature and levels of consciousness, the author stresses how aligning the self, or ego, with the soul, or higher consciousness, through self-awareness and obedience to God-given laws of behaviour, will lead to stability and inner light. This must be worked on in this life so that we prepare for the next. We cannot be 'happy' in the afterlife if we have been selfish and heedless in this one.\n\nThe last section of the book describes the Qur'anic teachings about the afterlife, the period immediately after death, the resurrection and the ultimate return to Allah. We are told we need have no fear if our self has been aligned to our soul through \"faith, trust in god, good deeds, transformative worship, purity of heart and other religious acts...\" finally we need simply to surrender to the Absolute. On p 125 (of the printed copy of this book) we are told that the Prophet described four qualities which will help us remain in peace on the day of judgment. Read the book to find out!!"

        title: "The Chishtis: Sufi Masters of India",
        author: "Muneera Haeri",
        description: "The Chishtis are one of the most beloved and enduring of the Sufi Orders, which emerged in the Indian Subcontinent in medieval times. The widespread acceptance of the teachings of Islam in the region was largely due to brotherhoods, such as the Chishtis, rather than through military conquest. The Sufis lived the message of original Islam and by the example of their lives attracted many to their way of being.\n\nThe founder of the order in the Indian Subcontinent was Shaykh Mu`in ad-Din Chishti of Ajmer, commonly known as Gharib Nawaz (Helper of the Poor), whose shrine continues to this day to be a popular place of pilgrimage for Muslim and Hindu alike. Muneera Haeri narrates the lives and teachings of Shaykh Mu`in ad-Din Chishti and five of his key successors, Shaykh Qutb ad-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki, Shaykh Hamid ad-Din Sufi Nagauri, Shaykh Farid ad-Din Mas`ud Ganj-i-Shakar, Shaykh Nizam ad-Din Awliya and Shaykh Nasir ad-Din Mahmud Chiragh-i-Delhi. All Masters from what is fondly remembered as the Golden Age of the Chishtis.\n\nThe book places the teachings of the Chishtiya in its historical perspective, but also emphasises their timeless message of love, compassion and tolerance for all. Their Masters often had dialogues with Hindu and Buddhist men of knowledge. They emphasised the importance of service and charitable acts as a means for self-purification. They fed Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Living as ascetics, they avoided contact with the sultans and their courts. Above all their qawwalis, or spiritual songs, attracted people to Islam.\n\nThe story of Amir Khusrau, the father of qawwalis and his devotion to Shaykh Nizam ad-Din Awliya is one of the many examples given of the impact the Chishti teachings had on celebrated historical personages. Through extracts from contemporary writings, the reader is transported to the gatherings of these medieval Masters and can imbibe the message of eternal Truth, through teachings that are as real and pertinent today as they were to the people of those times.\n\n<i>'The Chishtiya have at last found an articulate voice in English through the personal commitment and literary skill of Muneera Haeri.'</i> -- Bruce B. Lawrence, Professor Emeritus, Duke University.\n\n<br>ABOUT MUNEERA HAERI</b>\n\nMuneera Haeri is of Scottish origin. Born in Malaysia, educated in the U.K., she converted to Islam at the age of twenty-five. Muneera is married to Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, a teaching Sufi Shaykh.\n\nMuneera's family has had a long connection with India, spanning two hundred years. She has visited India and Pakistan extensively, and has a great love of both countries, their peoples and history. This is her first book.\n\nHer second book 'Sufi Encounters', which she co-authored with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, was published by Watkins in 2018.",

This wisdom strips away our conventional responses to events, actions and phenomena, and encourage us to concentrate on the only true Reality.\n\nWith the publication of Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's new translation and with the aid of his accompanying commentary, students and adepts alike can now gain a profounder understanding of these timeless teachings from the wellspring of the heart of Islam.",

        reviews: "<b>By Sadiqa</b>\n\n\"<i>We will not understand the world unless we understand the individual..We will not make headway unless we understand the 'I'...</i>\"\n\nBased on a series of talks given in the 80s, The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment is, more than ever, relevant to our times when more and more of us question the purpose of life and values that go beyond materialism.\n\nOver the years, the book's timeless and universal message has appealed to seekers world wide and has been an inspiration and revelation for many, including myself.\n\nI was interested in Islam but found I was unable to 'connect' with what I felt to be a cultural view. I was given The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment in its pre-published format -- Self Knowledge.\n\nThe book made complete sense to me. I carried it around for years --highlighted it -- wondering who the author was -- this was before the days of ISBN. I was even teaching Muslim friends from the book, which made absolute sense.\n\nThen -- by 'coincidence' -- I met the author's wife -- who gifted me a copy of a book just published by her husband. It was The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment.\n\nShaykh Fadhlalla emphasises the absolute need for self-knowledge as an essential tool for a committed seeker... A simple description is given of all aspects of the self and \"our ultimate purpose in life...to get rid of the 'I'\".\n\nThe book is a must, both for Muslims needing more in-depth explanation of the inner meanings of their rituals, and for non-Muslims, needing clarification of Islamic practices and their ultimate purpose.\n\nA short book, The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment can be read in an evening, and re-read for life. I still have my battered copy -- bound together with sellotape. It was instrumental to a profound understanding of the Sufi Islamic teachings. I will never throw it away."

        description: "In this autobiography the atmosphere of an Iraq in transition is brought to life with all its sights, sounds and political realities. But the author's personal concern and quest has always been spiritual rather than political, so the national and cultural upheavals are used as a backdrop for his own journey of self discovery and search for truth. For everyone interested in the events that created modern Iraq, in how Muslims view their own history and in how the message of Islam meets both individual needs and that of the world today, this is a timely and thought-provoking book.\n\n'<i>A new dawn has also appeared in spiritual travelogues with the publication of Son of Karbala. It deserves a place among the great spiritual odysseys of our time, right next to Gurdjieff's <b>Meetings with Remarkable Men</b>, which is at once resembles and exceeds in its honesty and clarity.</i>'\n\n-- Professor Bruce B. Lawrence, Duke University, Durham NC ",
