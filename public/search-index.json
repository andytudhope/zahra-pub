    "description": "\"There are numerous challenges and quests in human life. The most powerful drive, however, is to understand and connect with that which is timeless and boundless. Our keen interest in the beginning of creation and its end is part of this quest. The Qur’an is the voice of truth which involves what is considered to be rational and shareable consciousness. The majesty of the Qur’an is that it addresses most of the human situation and day to day realities whilst connecting it with the Absolute and Boundless. At a normal, conditioned, human consciousness, the Qur’an can help to reduce suffering and discord, but a point is reached where spiritual insights go beyond the mind and into the realm of the soul where discernment and differentiations melt away into a zone where energy and matter are not distinguishable. For this reason, most classical scholars of Qur’an refer to this higher level as the Divine Domain and refrain from commenting or discussing it.\"\n – From the Foreword by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri\n\nThe Irfani reflections and commentaries presented by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri in this book provide a bridge between rational understanding and spiritual insights of the Qur’an.

    "description": "This is the full, hardcover version. You can find each of the five sections separately in the Qur'an section.\n\nThese commentaries on several essential chapters of the Qur'an are based on Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's teachings in the West. The chapters include Surahs Fatiha, Baqarah, Ale `Imran, Yaseen, Al `Ankabut, Al Rahman, Al Waq`iah, Al Mulk and the entire Juz `Amma (last section of the Qur'an). These explorations of selected chapters of the Qur'an are aimed at those seeking guidance and transformation in the modern world. Emphasising the timeless wisdom of the Qur'an, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri uses the linguistic roots of the key terms to offer illuminating insights into its deep inner meanings, and shows its relevance to our present day lives. As a source of understanding for both Muslims and non-Muslims, this volume of 5 parts will be greatly valued.\n\nThe Qur'an reflects the absolute truth in all respects. It guides towards knowledge of numerous realities. In it one hears the eternal song of mercy, love and the oneness of creational reality. In the Qur'an we see the laws which govern the experiential, physical word as well as the subtle hidden worlds above and below.\n\nThe Qur'an tells the story of creation from before creation to beyond the end of creation. It takes one to its source--the timeless, boundless, All-Encompassing Absolute Creator.\n\nKeys to the Qur'an is based on discourses given by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri in America and Europe.

This selection of key verses are universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.\n\nThis book presents Qur'anic Universal renderings that connects the absolute and the relative in a unified voice that transforms and transports the reader to the eternal reality that is both transcendent and immanent.

Considerable emphasis is given to relative time and human concerns on earth and the connection between the inseparability of the relative and the Absolute. The Qur'an emphasizes that anything that exists or happens is due to God and equally emphasizes human responsibility to act and live with clear accountability to God.\n\nThe main difference between other traditions and religions at the time of the Prophet Muhammad is the perplexing notion that, in truth, there is only God, and all else are shadows in this Light.\n\nTo understand the Qur’an and use it as a template, this brief background is necessary. This booklet presents extracts from talks I have given on the subject, arranged in six themes: Context and Action, the Self, Understanding, Transformation, Awakening and lastly Oneness and Balance.\"\n\n- From the Introduction by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri ",

Then, when we have bridged this gap between our intellectual knowledge and what is already written in our hearts we see, on looking back to the shore we left, the whole landscape of our existence from an entirely new perspective.\n\nThe creation of the Universe is the eternal instant unfolding in time. There was the 'nothingness' and with the fiat of creation, 'kun fa-yakun', the 'nothingness' was split into the duality of existence, symbolized in the first Arabic letter 'alif', the primary mark of creation that descends from God. Viewed from the other side of time, from where we stand, there was this vast creation of immense energy that flung everything into separation, which we can liken to an explosion, or theorize as the 'Big Bang'.

We long for a state where we have no concerns, anxieties or needs, just living in the Garden in the eternal drift of time. Only a few reach a point of bewilderment when they are not certain whether the Garden is in them or they are in the Garden. Truth is beyond space and time; therefore, its apparent confusion is a big grace when the ‘you’ is lost and the cosmic Oneness illuminates all.\n\nCosmic Light is boundless and eternal. Throughout human history, irrespective of religious orientation or culture, people have reflected on the eternal truth of this reality. Some of these sages, like Shaykh Sa`d ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī, were able to convey this in a universal light. In my experience and understanding, the conditioned consciousness of human beings has within it a drive towards higher consciousness and intelligence. Throughout our history, this appears in diverse ways and forms, cloaked within the culture of the time. With the rise in intelligence and education, today’s people can easily understand duality and the quest for unity without it being too esoteric. Young people today can also easily appreciate the truth that our existence has emerged from a mysterious unific source and will return to it after the end of time. Every one of us is challenged by the mystery of now, which is ever-changing and constant, and the unique gift of life.\n\nAll quests and teachings lead to the realization that the soul, or essence of life, is eternal and that the moment radiates from timelessness. We are obsessed with that which is eternal and ever-present. In my lifelong search to uncover and share the dazzling lights of Truth, I have been propelled to make more accessible translations of specific seminal texts from the Sufi tradition available, as I have done with ‘The Secret Garden’. This book, ‘Pathways to the Garden’ is presented as an update to key questions for today’s time.\n\n- Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri",

It is the nature of human culture, thought and personal consciousness to continually operate in a dualistic way, so that Reality is obscured by several layers of fragmentation.\n\nThe ultimate harmony of human consciousness with universal reality is the challenge of existence.

    "description": "The Chishtis are one of the most beloved and enduring of the Sufi Orders, which emerged in the Indian Subcontinent in medieval times. The widespread acceptance of the teachings of Islam in the region was largely due to brotherhoods, such as the Chishtis, rather than through military conquest. The Sufis lived the message of original Islam and by the example of their lives attracted many to their way of being.\n\nThe founder of the order in the Indian Subcontinent was Shaykh Mu`in ad-Din Chishti of Ajmer, commonly known as Gharib Nawaz (Helper of the Poor), whose shrine continues to this day to be a popular place of pilgrimage for Muslim and Hindu alike. Muneera Haeri narrates the lives and teachings of Shaykh Mu`in ad-Din Chishti and five of his key successors, Shaykh Qutb ad-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki, Shaykh Hamid ad-Din Sufi Nagauri, Shaykh Farid ad-Din Mas`ud Ganj-i-Shakar, Shaykh Nizam ad-Din Awliya and Shaykh Nasir ad-Din Mahmud Chiragh-i-Delhi. All Masters from what is fondly remembered as the Golden Age of the Chishtis.\n\nThe book places the teachings of the Chishtiya in its historical perspective, but also emphasises their timeless message of love, compassion and tolerance for all. Their Masters often had dialogues with Hindu and Buddhist men of knowledge. They emphasised the importance of service and charitable acts as a means for self-purification. They fed Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Living as ascetics, they avoided contact with the sultans and their courts. Above all their qawwalis, or spiritual songs, attracted people to Islam.\n\nThe story of Amir Khusrau, the father of qawwalis and his devotion to Shaykh Nizam ad-Din Awliya is one of the many examples given of the impact the Chishti teachings had on celebrated historical personages. Through extracts from contemporary writings, the reader is transported to the gatherings of these medieval Masters and can imbibe the message of eternal Truth, through teachings that are as real and pertinent today as they were to the people of those times.\n\n'The Chishtiya have at last found an articulate voice in English through the personal commitment and literary skill of Muneera Haeri.' -- Bruce B. Lawrence, Professor Emeritus, Duke University.\n\nABOUT MUNEERA HAERI\n\nMuneera Haeri is of Scottish origin. Born in Malaysia, educated in the U.K., she converted to Islam at the age of twenty-five.

    "description": "The Hikam, or Wisdom, of the great Sufi Master Ibn `Ata 'Allah al-Iskandari has long been acknowledged as an essential and classic masterwork of the Islamic science of enlightenment. Ibn `Ata 'Allah exemplified the ultimate model of a Sufi master possessed of a deep foundation in the sciences of the Qur'an, the way of the Prophet and the Universal Laws of the Islamic way of life, both outer and inner.\n\nShort but immensely thought provoking, dense in their significance and insightfulness, crisp and sharp in their elucidation, the aphoristic Hikam are a true manifesto for those who are sincerely on the path of knowledge and awareness. This wisdom strips away our conventional responses to events, actions and phenomena, and encourage us to concentrate on the only true Reality.\n\nWith the publication of Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's new translation and with the aid of his accompanying commentary, students and adepts alike can now gain a profounder understanding of these timeless teachings from the wellspring of the heart of Islam.",
