# Zahra Publications

This is a custom [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) website, built specifically to display information about books published by [Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri](https://shaykhfadhlallahaeri.com/).

## Getting Started

The first thing to do is create the search index, after which you can run the site as you normally would:

```bash
npm run generate-search
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
